                We collect as little data as possible. No tracking what kind of
                coffee you like or your deepest secrets.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some non-creepy cookies might be used to keep the site
                functional. No chocolate chip cookies, unfortunately.
              </li>
              <li>
                We don&apos;t sell, trade, or give away your data, not even for
                a lifetime supply of pizza (tempting, though).
              </li>
              <li>
                If you think we have some of your data and want it gone, just
                let us know, and we&apos;ll make it disappear (legally, of
                course).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mt-6">
              If any of this concerns you, consider wearing a tinfoil hatâ€¦ or
              just reach out, and we&apos;ll happily clarify!
